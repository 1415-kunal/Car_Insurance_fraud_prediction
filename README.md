## 📌 Project Overview

Insurance fraud costs companies billions of dollars every year. Detecting fraudulent claims early helps insurance providers reduce financial losses and improve claim processing efficiency.

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a **car insurance claim** is **Fraudulent** or **Genuine**. The application includes a professional **Streamlit dashboard** that allows users to enter claim information and receive real-time predictions.
